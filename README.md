# TASKS-Admin Client: React.js simple CRUD with users management (LogIn, SignUp, LogOut)

### This project is the CLIENT side of a MERN FULL-STACK project. It was developed in june 2022 to practice applying and integrating some technologies that where new for me at that time. (server side in https://github.com/juliosalas89/tasks-backend)

## Some technologies implemented:
1- Authentication with JSON Web Token.\
2- axios.\
3- useContext React Hook.\
4- useReducer React Hook.


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
